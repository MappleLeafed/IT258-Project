# finGAT_1

## Project Overview
This project implements a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for financial data analysis. The notebook, `finGAT_1.ipynb`, contains code for preprocessing financial datasets, constructing graph structures, and training a GAT model to analyze relationships between financial entities.

## Features
- **Graph Construction**: Transforms financial data into a graph-based representation.
- **GAT Implementation**: Uses the Graph Attention Network (GAT) to analyze node relationships.
- **Data Processing**: Prepares financial data for graph-based learning.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Includes training loops and evaluation metrics.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook finGAT_1.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell sequentially to execute data processing, graph construction, and model training.
3. Run only the #RUN blocks for task 3 and 4 it is  assumed that the data is present in the working directory.

## Folder Structure
- `finGAT_1.ipynb` - Main Jupyter Notebook containing code and explanations.
- Assumed files are already present in given folders in the functions
